OWLSugar
========

	$Rev: 178 $

	OWLSugar is a library for manipulation of OWL documents using OO 
	techniques in Python.

Building
--------

You can build the egg files by using:

./setup.py bdist_egg

You will need the following 

Documentation
-------------

API documentation is embedded and can be generated by running the command:

./gendocs.sh

This will create the necessary HTML in doc/api.	This will however need 
epydoc version 3.0 (or greater I presume).

Tests
-----

Run the unit tests with:

./setup.py nosetests

				pylint, and epydoc.
