This file is designed to contain some notes regarding the OWL 1.1 
specifications that are being ratified. These include gotcha's - ambiguities -
and plain old "bugs".

Functions/Objects to be aware of    	  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When analyzing the Syntax specification, there are ambiguities regarding the
differences between the Structural model and the Functional model. The 
following functions are what I would consider "special cases".
    	  
- URI: its a terminal - so it actually _is_ data. It does have constraint of
	its own - defined by being either an RFC3897 IRI or a "CURRIE" (defined
	by the W3C. See section 2.2 of the Syntax guide.
- Constant: Again - a terminal - contains data - but also has an optional complex 
	relationship (datatypeURI). It also has a language option - not shown in the
	structural representation. The constraints around this data are defined
	in section 4.1 of the Syntax guide.	
- Namespace: Actually defined functionally but not structurally. It is the only
	function that sites outside of the Ontology, being that it is treated 
	specially when OWL translates to N3 or XML.
- Label: A label is an Annotation with a pre-defined URI set to rdf:label. 
  	It is represented as a function, however not listed structurally. Really,
  	it is more of a child of Annotation - with its annotationURI pre-set.
- Comment: A comment is an annotation with a pre-defined URI set to rdf:comment.
	It is represented as a function, however not listed structurally. Really,
  	it is more of a child of Annotation - with its annotationURI pre-set.
- Datatype: Represented structurally, but its not a terminal function. Its really
	just a URI, but it it usually an enumeration of the standard XSD data types.
- DatatypeRestriction: This is a customisation on top of a datatype that adds
	a variation to the ordinary <<set>> <<list>> stereo types called 
	"facetType". This seems to be because it would be messy to draw all of the
	possibly relationship types into the diagram ... you should probably treat
	each of the facets as an optional argument ... with a cardinality of 1 for
	each.
- DataRange: While arity is defined structurally - I can't find how it is 
	defined functionally. I'm not even 100% on what arity is for - it seems to 
	represent how many of this "DataType" is required ... not sure ??

Predefined or Implicit Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These are implicit "instances" of OWl functions that need no mention when 
serialised - yet none-the-less really do exist and must be represented
internally by tooling.

Namespace:
 - rdf
 - rdfs
 - xsd
 - owl
 - owl11
 - owl11xml
OWLClass:
 - owl:Thing
 - owl:Nothing
